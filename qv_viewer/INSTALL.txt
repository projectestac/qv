Quaderns Virtuals (QV)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compilation instructions:

The current version of QV_VIEWER compiles with version 1.4 or later of the 
Java Development Toolkit (JDK).

Before to compile it's necessary to revise the content of the following properties 
files:
- src/viewer/log4j.properties
- src/viewer/edu/xtec/resources/properties/qv_viewer.properties
- src/zipfolder/edu/xtec/resources/properties/qv_transformer.properties
- src/zipfolder/edu/xtec/resources/properties/zipFolder.properties


Compilation for deployment in a server (like IAS Oracle, for instance) is done with 
Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/), version 1.6.5 or later. To compile, just open a 
console, go to the root directory of the source code (where the build.xml file is located) 
and invoke "ant". At the end of the build process, the resulting EAR files will appear 
into the "dist" directory.
